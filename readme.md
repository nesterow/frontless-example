### Isomorphic application stack for RiotJS
Frontless aims to provide classic web development experience with modern approach. 
It was heavily inspired by NextJS.

#### Installation
`npx frontless <app-name>` or `npx create-frontless <app-name>`
```
  yarn
  yarn start
```
Ðžpen [http://localhost:6767](http://localhost:6767) in your browser. Navigate to the playground for examples 


## About
There are things that the server does better.
Classic MVVM approach significanly complicates work with data. In fact, on practice a frontend developer would end up writing the code that would be better performed by server rather than a client (routing, requesting data, filtering data, cooking a view model, caching, etc). 
I believe that the server has to be responsible for the view model. There are things which the server does better and working with data is one of them.


## The Stack

| Server        | Client        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Routing (Express.JS ) | Navigation (Turbolinks) |
| View Model (FeathersJS)    | Data Representation (RiotJS) |
| Layout Rendering (RiotJS SSR) | User input (RiotJS)  |
| Session / User State (Express.js) | JWT, Cookies |
| Realtime (Feathers, SocketIO) | FeathersJS Client |
| DB Interface (FeathersJS Client) | Rest/IO (FeathersJS Client) |

## Features
#### 1. Natural Routing
All files ending with `*.riot` placed in the `pages` become site pages, much like php scripts or html pages.
Unlike `next.js`, Frontless does not provide complex routing schemes, so at the time all parameters can only be passed trough HTTP query.

#### 2. Server side rendering
All RiotJS components included in pages will render after all data is fetched. 
Use method `fetch(props)` in your components to make db queries and setting components' state on the server.
Unlike similar method in `next.js`, in Frontless you can fetch data in any children component 
and your page will be rendered after all fetch operations are complete.

```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(props) {
    const {params, session} = props.req
    const userProfile = await db.users.get(session.user.id)
    this.update({
      username: session.username,
      userProfile
    })
  }
}
```

### Server sent state
###### * or Server Sent View Model 
Some API requests can return a ready view-model for a specific component. 
After it happens the target component will update its state from received response. 
This is convenient whenever you want to update the view after a request is done. 
Given that, the server should return a ready view-model which eliminates extra steps you would do to handle response.

Normally, you should follow 3 steps to make it work:

1. Give your component an unique id
```javascript
export default {
  id: 'uniq-id', // target id
  state: {
    message:''
  }
  ...
}
```
2. Use method app.setState() to compose a response
```javascript
app.use('myservice',{
    async create(data){
      return app.setState('uniq-id', {
        message: 'Hello!'
      })
    }
})
```
3. On the client make a call to service method which suppose to return new state
```javascript
client.service('myservice').create({})
```
Notice that you don't need to handle API call as the server supposed to return ready view-model for your component. 
The UI will update automatically. However, you still nedd to handle loading states and errors.
